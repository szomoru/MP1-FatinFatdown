Welcome to my page FatinFatdown,

This is a motivational page for those people who are strugling with weight issues. The main purpose of the page to share experience and let the 
people follow my progress during my transformation process. 

The website is continously updated to add more and more information and also a weekly update on my progress. Also help the readers to decide which workout program they should choose and get first hand information how they are working. 

The website has to main sections:

- Fatin:
    The topic of this section is healthy eating (diet) which is focusing on the nowadays so popular Ketogenic diet.

- Fatdown:
    Since the result of the diets can be boosted by different workouts, this section is focusing on the workout programs (mainly no or minimal equipment bodyweight workouts).
